# Authentication and background processing (Optional)

To allow banks update/removal by authenticated user, biomaj-daemon (micro service architecture) must be running


# API / REST interface

The old API interface (/BmajWatcher/GET) is still available. A new REST
interface is available but we kept the old one for compatibility for other
tools. The old interface does not take advantage of the new features however.

# Don't like the color? Need your logo?

You can easily customize the look of the watcher. Theme is pure CSS and CSS giles are available in directroy biomajwatcher/webapp/app/styles. CSS are based on Bootstrap 3. You may also need to override some directives from *app.css* according to your theme (font color...)

If you want to customize the theme, create a new theme CSS file (with an other name), and update the <link> reference to "_path_to_styles_/theme.css" to your new file in biomajwatcher/webapp/app/index.html.

In index.html you can also add your logo, change header, etc...
